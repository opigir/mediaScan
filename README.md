# mediaScan
Problem: I have large backups of the raw data from the datawrangling from many video and photo projects, the RAW data is not required as many of those projects have been completed. These files are nested deep within project folders. 

Solution: Scan for large media folders and search for camera folder names to decide if you need to keep it or remove it to clear space. This script WILL NOT DELETE ANY FILES but will allow you to open the folder and manually do so.
